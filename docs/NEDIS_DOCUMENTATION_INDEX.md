## Key Documentation Principles

### üìö **No-Hardcoding Philosophy**
The system completely avoids hardcoded distributions and assumptions:
- **Dynamic Pattern Learning**: All patterns learned from actual data
- **Hierarchical Fallback**: Multiple levels of specificity with statistical validation
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Self-adjusting based on data characteristics
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bootstrap confidence intervals and quality metrics

### üîí **Privacy-First Design**  
Comprehensive privacy protection through multiple mechanisms:
- **K-Anonymity**: Group privacy through suppression and generalization
- **L-Diversity**: Protection against homogeneity attacks
- **T-Closeness**: Distribution similarity preservation
- **Differential Privacy**: Mathematical privacy guarantees with noise addition
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Comprehensive privacy risk assessment

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
High-performance implementation with:
- **Vectorized Operations**: 10-100x speedup over loop-based approaches
- **Memory Management**: Optimized data types and batch processing
- **Intelligent Caching**: Pattern analysis results cached for efficiency
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large datasets with minimal resource usage

## Architecture Highlights

### Pattern Analysis Engine
- **Empirical Distribution Learning**: No parametric assumptions
- **Statistical Model Selection**: Automatic choice of best-fit models
- **Cross-Validation**: Rigorous validation of learned patterns
- **Information-Theoretic Fallbacks**: Principled hierarchy based on mutual information

### Synthetic Data Generation
- **Correlation Preservation**: Maintain statistical relationships
- **Clinical Validity**: Ensure medical plausibility
- **Temporal Modeling**: NHPP for realistic arrival patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-level validation framework

### Privacy Framework
- **Mathematical Guarantees**: Formal privacy definitions and proofs
- **Flexible Strategies**: Multiple approaches for different data types
- **Budget Management**: Systematic privacy budget allocation and tracking
- **Utility Preservation**: Minimize information loss while ensuring privacy
