## Key Principles

This documentation follows the **No Hardcoding Principle**: All patterns and distributions are learned dynamically from real data rather than using hardcoded assumptions.

### Pattern Learning Approach
- **Empirical Distributions**: Learn from actual data patterns
- **Hierarchical Fallback**: Multiple levels of specificity with statistical validation
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Algorithms that adjust to data characteristics
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bootstrap confidence intervals and quality metrics

### Privacy-First Design
- **K-anonymity**: Ensure group privacy through suppression and generalization
- **Differential Privacy**: Add statistical noise to protect individual records
- **L-diversity**: Maintain diversity in sensitive attributes
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-layer privacy risk assessment
